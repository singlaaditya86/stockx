You will land on the main page on which we can select a company whose data will be displayed. On the left side of the website we can see the top 5 trending stocks. 

After selecting the stocks in the main page we can see the realtime data for the chosen stock with the help of the API.

The headers include CAGR function, SearchBar, and the SIP Function. The CAGR function will calculates the Compounded Annually Growth Rate.which requires a company name and the day you invested it in. The SIP Function calculates the Systematic investment plan of stocks.
